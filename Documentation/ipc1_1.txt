Python 2 and Python 3 have several differences:

Python 2 is legacy software that was retired at the start of 2020. The code base is no longer maintained.

In Python 2, integer division rounds down a calculation to the nearest whole number.
Python2: 5/3 = 1 whereas in Python 3: 5/3 = 1.666667

Python 2 stores strings as ASCII by default but by default, Python 3 stores string as Unicode.

Python 2 does not use parentheses for print statement but Python 3 requires them.
ex: python 2 => print "Hello"
ex: python 3 => print ("Hello")

Additionally, Python 3 includeds a string formatter in the string class str.format(). 
ex: print("{} / {} = {}".format(8, 2, 8/2)) outputs "8 / 2 = 4".
